<b>THE ARENA :</b> This game is played on a board which is a matrix of white spaces
30 rows by 32 lines. The falling blocks are specific configurations of four
squares. These blocks fall, one at a time, from the top of a board until they
either reach the bottom of the board or reach a square on the board that is
already filled. When a piece stops falling, it fills in the squares of the board that
it occupies, and then the next piece begins falling.<br>
<b>GAMEPLAY </b>: Using keys on the keyboard, the player can control the block by
rotating it or move it left /right. Whenever an entire row of the board is filled,
that row is removed and all the rows above it are moved down.<br>
<b>OBJECTIVE</b> :The objective is to keep playing as long as possible, which is
accomplished by filling in rows in order to remove them. When there is no
longer room on the board to drop another piece, the game ends.<br>

SCORING : Each piece dropped scores 10 points. Each row removed scores an extra 100 points. <br>

<b>CONTROLS: </b> Use the keys 'a' & 'd' to move
the falling block left or right. Using key 's' the blocks can rotate clockwise. By
pressing the spacebar key, the block should instantly fall below to its place on
the board.Block can be moved with the help of arrow keys too. <br>
